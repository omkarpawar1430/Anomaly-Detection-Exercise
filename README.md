# Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest and Data Transformation

In this GitHub project, we leverage Isolation Forest for anomaly detection on a dataset containing various features. The primary goal is to identify anomalies in the dataset while also preserving the data for potential future analysis. Here's a concise overview of the steps taken:

## Data Loading and Preparation:

The dataset includes categorical features like 'method', 'country', and 'os', which are one-hot encoded to convert them into numerical format.
'start_date_x', 'start_date_y', and 'Time' columns are converted to timestamp values for numerical compatibility.

## Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection:

We employ the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection. This algorithm partitions the data and isolates anomalies based on their separation from normal instances.
Anomalies are detected using the trained Isolation Forest model, which assigns labels (-1 for anomalies and 1 for normal instances).

## Data Transformation for Anomaly Detection:

The 'id', 'device_id', 'user_id', and 'organization_id' columns are label-encoded to allow their inclusion in the anomaly detection process.
The 'start_date_x', 'start_date_y', and 'Time' columns are converted to timestamp values for continuous feature representation.

## GitHub Project Description:

This GitHub project includes code snippets, explanations, and data transformation techniques used to perform anomaly detection with Isolation Forest.
The goal is to help others understand how to preprocess and transform their data effectively to apply anomaly detection algorithms.

The provided code can be adapted to various use cases and datasets for anomaly detection tasks.
Feel free to explore the code and adjust it to your own dataset. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
